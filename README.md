## MyButton Library

# Description
An Arduino library for handling button inputs with debouncing and multi-click detection. This library supports detecting short clicks, long presses, and double clicks on a button connected to an Arduino pin (configured as INPUT_PULLDOWN by default). 

# Features
Detects short clicks, long presses, and double clicks.
Configurable debounce delay, long press duration, and double-click window.

# Installation
To install, use the Arduino Library Manager and search for "MyButton Library" and install the library. Alternatively, you can manually download this repository and place it in your Arduino libraries folder (.\LIB\MyButton).

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome!  Not only you’ll encourage the development of the library, but you’ll also learn how to best use the library and probably some C++ too
